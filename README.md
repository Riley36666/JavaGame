# 🎮 JavaGame

Welcome to **JavaGame**, a small 2D game built entirely in **Java Swing**.  
This was my **first ever programming project**, created to learn the fundamentals of game development, graphics, and user input handling in Java.

---

## 🕹️ Overview

JavaGame is a simple desktop game that includes:
- A **Start Menu**
- A **Level Selector**
- An **Options Menu**
- Multiple playable **Levels**
- Custom **graphics and settings**

It’s a lightweight, pure Java project — no external libraries or engines.

## ✨ Features

✅ Classic 2D graphics using `JPanel` and `Graphics2D`  
✅ Level and settings system (`settings.properties`)  
✅ Keyboard input and basic animations  
✅ Menu screens for navigation  
✅ Organized assets (images, sounds)

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- How to structure a Java project
- How rendering loops and frame updates work
- How to handle keyboard input in Swing
- How to organize files and manage game state
- The importance of clean code and modularity

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- [Java JDK 17+](https://adoptium.net/) (or any version supporting Swing)
- A Java IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **VS Code** with Java support

### Running from the Command Line
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Riley36666/JavaGame.git
cd JavaGame

# Compile all .java files
javac *.java

# Run the game
java Main
